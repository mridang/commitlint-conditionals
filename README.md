# Commitlint - Conditional Rules Plugin

A [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)
plugin to enable conditional application of linting rules based on various
commit attributes, such as author patterns or message content.

This plugin helps ensure that commit message conventions can be flexibly
enforced. For instance, it allows for different linting standards for
human-authored commits versus automated commits (e.g., from bots), or for
varying rules based on the type of changes being committed. It is designed
to be extended with more conditional capabilities over time.

### Why?

Maintaining consistent and meaningful commit messages is crucial for project
health, enabling better collaboration, clearer history, and automated
changelog generation. [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) is an excellent
tool for enforcing these conventions.

However, a one-size-fits-all linting approach isn't always optimal.
Different types of commits or contributions might warrant different levels of
scrutiny or slightly varied rules:

- **Automated Commits:** Commits generated by bots (e.g., Dependabot,
  Renovate, CI scripts) often have a standardized, machine-generated format.
  Applying the same strict linting rules designed for human contributors can
  be overly restrictive or lead to unnecessary failures for these automated
  processes. It's often desirable to either bypass linting for these bots or
  apply a more lenient set of rules.
- **Work-in-Progress or Specific Branch Types:** Teams might want to enforce
  strict rules on main development lines (`main`, `develop`) but allow more
  flexibility on feature branches or for commits marked as "WIP" (Work In
  Progress).
- **Evolving Standards:** As a project evolves, you might want to introduce
  new linting rules but apply them conditionally at first, or only to
  certain types of commits, before making them universal.

This plugin, `@mridang/commitlint-conditionals`, aims to provide the
flexibility to handle such scenarios. It allows you to define conditions
(initially based on author patterns) under which commit linting rules are
applied differently, or even skipped entirely. This helps maintain high
standards for human contributions where needed, while accommodating the
practicalities of automated systems and diverse development workflows,
ultimately leading to a more effective and less burdensome commit linting
process.

## Installation

Install using NPM by using the following command:

```sh
npm install --save @mridang/commitlint-conditionals
```

## Usage

To use this plugin, add `@mridang/commitlint-conditionals` to your `commitlint`
configuration file (e.g., `commitlint.config.js` or `.commitlintrc.js`).

You'll need to list it in the `plugins` array. The rules provided by this
plugin will then be available to be configured in the `rules` object, prefixed
with the plugin's name.

First, add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your `commitlint` configuration:

```javascript
/**
 * @type {import('@commitlint/types').UserConfig}
 */
const config = {
  extends: [
    '@commitlint/config-conventional', // Or your preferred base configuration
  ],
  plugins: [
    '@mridang/commitlint-conditionals', // Add the plugin by its package name
  ],
  rules: {
    // Rule configuration will go here
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

#### Configuring the `ignoreForAuthors` Rule

This rule is the core of the plugin.

**Rule Name:** `@mridang/commitlint-conditionals/ignore-for-authors`

**Options (`IgnoreForAuthorsRuleOptions`):**

The rule accepts an object with the following properties:

- `ignoreAuthorPatterns?: string[]`:

  - An array of string patterns (e.g., `['dependabot[bot]', 'renovate-bot']`).
  - If a pattern matches content in the raw commit message, the rules
    defined in `rulesToEnforce` are bypassed for that commit.

- `rulesToEnforce?: ExternalRuleToEnforce[]`:
  - An array of rule configurations to apply if the commit is **not** from an
    ignored author.
  - Each entry is an object:
    - `packageName: string`: NPM package name (e.g., `'@commitlint/rules'`).
    - `ruleName: string`: Rule name within that package (e.g., `'type-enum'`).
    - `value: unknown`: Configuration value for that rule.

**Behavior:**

1.  If `ignoreAuthorPatterns` match, this rule passes, and its configured
    `rulesToEnforce` are skipped.
2.  If no `ignoreAuthorPatterns` match, each rule in `rulesToEnforce` is
    dynamically loaded and executed. If any fail, this rule fails.
3.  This rule is **asynchronous**.

**Important:** This rule only controls the execution of rules listed in its
`rulesToEnforce` option. Other rules from `extends` or elsewhere in your
main `rules` object will still apply to all commits unless explicitly
disabled or managed by a global dynamic configuration.

##### Example: Conditional Rules for Specific Authors

This example shows how to use `ignoreForAuthors` to apply different `body-max-line-length`
and `type-enum` settings for `dependabot[bot]` versus other users, while
still inheriting other rules from `@commitlint/config-conventional`.

```javascript
// commitlint.config.js
/**
 * @type {import('@commitlint/types').UserConfig}
 */
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
  plugins: ['@mridang/commitlint-conditionals'],
  rules: {
    /**
     * Disable these specific rules from '@commitlint/config-conventional'
     * because we want our plugin to control them conditionally.
     */
    'body-max-line-length': [0],
    'type-enum': [0],

    /**
     * Configure the rule from @mridang/commitlint-conditionals.
     * JSDoc types for options can be helpful for clarity:
     * @type {[number, string, import('@mridang/commitlint-conditionals').IgnoreForAuthorsRuleOptions]}
     */
    '@mridang/commitlint-conditionals/ignore-for-authors': [
      2, // Severity: Error for this conditional rule itself
      'always',
      {
        ignoreAuthorPatterns: ['dependabot[bot]'],
        rulesToEnforce: [
          // For non-dependabot users, enforce these:
          {
            packageName: '@commitlint/rules',
            ruleName: 'body-max-line-length',
            value: 100, // Standard limit for humans
          },
          {
            packageName: '@commitlint/rules',
            ruleName: 'type-enum',
            value: [
              // Standard types for humans
              'build',
              'chore',
              'ci',
              'docs',
              'feat',
              'fix',
              'perf',
              'refactor',
              'revert',
              'style',
              'test',
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    /**
     * Note: Other rules from '@commitlint/config-conventional' like
     * 'header-max-length', 'subject-empty', etc. (which were NOT disabled)
     * will STILL APPLY to ALL commits, including dependabot.
     * To truly bypass ALL rules for dependabot, see the next section.
     */
  },
};
```

## Known Issues

- **Rule Scope and Limitations:** The `ignore-for-authors` rule, when used as a standard plugin rule, identifies matching author patterns and will itself pass. However, it **does not prevent other configured `commitlint` rules from executing**. To achieve a full bypass of all linting for specific authors, a dynamic JavaScript/TypeScript configuration (`commitlint.config.js` or `.ts`) is necessary, as demonstrated in the [Usage](#usage) section. This is a fundamental aspect of how `commitlint` processes rules.
- **Author Pattern Specificity:** The effectiveness of the `ignore-for-authors` rule depends on the accuracy and specificity of the patterns provided. Vague patterns might unintentionally match more commits than desired. Patterns are checked against the raw commit message.
- **Dynamic Configuration Complexity:** While powerful, using a dynamic JavaScript/TypeScript configuration file to achieve a true bypass requires understanding how to structure this configuration and potentially how to access commit message content at the time the configuration is loaded (which can be environment-dependent, e.g., when using Git hooks like Husky).
